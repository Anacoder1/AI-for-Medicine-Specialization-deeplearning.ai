CHANGES TO RELEASE 2.9.3
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bug fixes: Serious impute() issue introduced in the last build (Bug 59
on GitHub).  Fix to compile time error on systems that do not support
OpenMP.  Here, the OpenMP code that was inadvertently exposed is now
protected when OpenMP support is not detected.  Also updated
impute.rfsc.Rd with a salient example.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
RELEASE 2.9.2
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bug fixes: Fix to Windows 10 OpenMP stack allocation error encountered
when survival and large n are encountered (Bug 50 on GitHub).  Fix to 
get.quantile.stat() (Bug 51 on GitHub).

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
RELEASE 2.9.1
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bug fixes to quantreg and some minor updates to other functions.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
RELEASE 2.9.0
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Added new splitrules "auc" and "entropy" for classification.
Improvements to quantile regression.  Updates to holdout vimp.  Some
function names were changed as a general move towards name uniformity
in the package.  Updates to function imbalanced used for class
imbalanced data.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
RELEASE 2.8.0
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ensembles in regression now support Greenwald-Khanna approximate
quantile queries via rfsrc(), predict.rfsrc() and the new wrapper
quantileReg.rfsrc(). Related to this, a new split rule "quantile.regr"
has been added.  Specifications will be added to the GitHub page,
shortly.  Another new wrapper, imbalanced.rfsrc(), implements various
solutions to the two-class imbalanced problem, including the newly
proposed quantile-classifier approach of O'Brien and Ishwaran (2017).
Also includes Breiman's balanced random forests undersampling of the
majority class.  Performance is assesssed using the G-mean, but
misclassification error can be requested. Also, the new parameter
get.tree in predict.rfsrc() allows users to extract the ensembles for
a single tree or subset of trees over the forest. Finally, the default
nodesize for survival and competing risk has been changed to 15.
    
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
RELEASE 2.7.0
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Three primary additions:
  (1) Subsample Forests for VIMP Confidence Intervals:
  Uses subsampling to calculate confidence intervals and standard
  errors for VIMP (variable importance). Applies to all families.
  (2) Tune Random Forest for the optimal mtry and nodesize parameters:
  Finds the optimal mtry and nodesize tuning parameter for a random
  forest using out-of-bag (OOB) error.  Applies to all families. 
  (3) Fast approximate random forests:  Uses subsampling with forest options
  set to encourage computational speed.  Applies to all families.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
RELEASE 2.6.1
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fix to predict() call not returning ensembles when y-vars not present.  Sorry
about that.
  
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
RELEASE 2.6.0
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Serious improvements to OpenMP performance after addressing issues
related to the blocking of threads during a number of calculations
involving ensembles, importance, forest weights, and partial plots
mostly in big-n data sets.
  
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
RELEASE 2.5.1
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Addition of configure file to source package allowing more accessible OpenMP
parallel execution on systems that support it.
  
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
RELEASE 2.5.0
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Introduction of conditional quantiles for a regression forest.
Applies to both univariate and multivariate forests.  Can be used for
both training and testing purposes and returns the conditional
quantiles for the target outcomes, and conditional density, which can
be used to calculate conditional moments, such as the mean and
standard deviation.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
RELEASE 2.4.2
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bug fixes to partial.rfsrc() on R and C side.  Allowance of second
order variable specification in this analysis.  Conditional importance
values in classification adjusted by a factor of exp(1).  Bug fix to unsafe
threading in LB-VIMP calculations.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
RELEASE 2.4.1
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fix to typedef that breaks Linux.  Sorry about that.
  
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
RELEASE 2.4.0
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fix to custom splitting family verification and registration harness.
Introduction of bootstrap="by.user".  Fix to incorrect mapping of user
specified time points to event times when ntime option is used.  It is
recommended that the use of this option be avoided.  The effect of
discretizing the time values compromises the ensembles. For best
results, all event times must be used.  This was and is the default
behaviour.  Fix to incorrect passing of time option parameter in
plot.variable().  Introduction of partial.rfsrc() to allow direct
access to partial ensembles.  Added support for long vectors on native
code side.

  
RELEASE 2.3.0
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
Fix to levels.count when ntree=1.  Some n-based loop optimization.
Significant improvements in CPU times for restore-predict modes, and
plot.variable().  Consequent changes to forest object, and
incompatibility with objects created with previous versions of the
package.  Default is now importance=FALSE in predict.rfsrc().

RELEASE 2.2.0
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bug fix to coerce.factor option via get.xvar.nlevels() and
get.yvar.nlevels() resolved by sending in max instead of number of
levels.  Bug fix to VIMP that potentially occurs in OpenMP mode
causing non-zero LB-VIMP. Methodological fix to in-node imputation.
and removal of na.random.  Consequent incompatibility with objects
created with previous versions of the package. Fix to rfsrcSyn() bug
pertaining to colnames of test set synthetic features. Introduction of
sampsize, samptype, and case.wt to address imbalanced data sets.
Continued improvements to CPU and memory performance in big-n, big-p,
and big-ntree scenarios.

rfsrcSyn() for fitting synthetic random forests.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
RELEASE 1.5.3
Addition of rfsrcSyn() function to grow a synthetic random forest (RF)
using RF machines as synthetic features.  Applies only to regression
and classification settings.  Used for prediction only.
